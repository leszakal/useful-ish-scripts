Scripts that might be nice to have.

Mainly so I don't have to retype sudo until the fingers fall off.
I promise no elegance within this code.

- __update_install_script.py__: Simple python3 script that does apt update, apt upgrade, and apt autoremove in one fell swoop. Also has an function for apt installing packages. Just uncomment out the function as desired. Must be run as root (just `sudo python3 update_install_script.py`).
